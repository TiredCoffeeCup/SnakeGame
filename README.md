## The Motive

This was just a project for my 12th Grade Practical Exam, it didn't have to be so advanced but it got me interested so I expanded on the project.

## The Learning

This project helped me improve in formatting code and write cleaner and more efficient code.

## Prerequisites

Python

Modules: 
* Pygame

## Usage

Just running the `Simulator.py` file is enough to start the programs, There are no other controls, so the model will automatically run and improve itself on its own.

## Closing Notes

Overall the code is very badly documented (not for long hopefully) and not really formatted according to classic Python guidelines. It's just supposed to be something I experimented on and nothing too serious.
